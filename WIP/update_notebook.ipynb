    "# Executive Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "### Goals\n",
    "- Identify drivers of log error\n",
    "- Create a model that predicts log error\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "- Deliver the following:\n",
    "    - zillow_clustering_project.ipynb\n",
    "    - README.md\n",
    "    - acquire.py\n",
    "    - prep.py\n",
    "    - model.py\n",
    "    - A presentation that walks through each step of our project and summarizes this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Through data exploration and modeling, we found evidence that the following features are drivers of log error\n",
    "- bedroom_count\n",
    "- property_sq_ft\n",
    "- tax_dollar_value\n",
    "\n",
    "Clusters created from a combination of bedroom_count and property_sq_ft are viable predictors of log error\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recommendation\n",
    "\n",
    "- Begin a project to improve the accuracy of our zillow estimate software using the insights and model generated from this project\n",
    "\n",
    "### Expectation\n",
    "\n",
    "- By improving the accuracy of our zestimates we will increase satisfaction among our current users and make our services more attractive to potential users. \n",
