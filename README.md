# The drivers of errors in single unit Zestimates at Zillow

## Background

From Zillow:

"Zillow is the leading real estate and rental marketplace dedicated to empowering consumers with data, inspiration and knowledge around the place they call home, and connecting them with the best local professionals who can help.

Zillow serves the full lifecycle of owning and living in a home: buying, selling, renting, financing, remodeling and more. It starts with Zillow's living database of more than 110 million U.S. homes - including homes for sale, homes for rent and homes not currently on the market, as well as Zestimate home values, Rent Zestimates and other home-related information. Zillow operates the most popular suite of mobile real estate apps, with more than two dozen apps across all major platforms."

## Goals
The primary goal of this project is to improve our original estimate of the log error by using clustering methodologies.

I will also deliver the following:

- zillow_clustering_project.ipynb
    - A Jupyter Notebook that includes an introduction, agenda, project planning steps, a breakdown of our project at each phase of the data science pipeline, and a conclusion.

- README.md
    - A markdown file that includes a background summary of Zillow, project goals, data dictionary, reason for selected columns, initial thoughts, initial hypothesis, project plan, steps for how to reproduce the project, and key findings / takeaways.
